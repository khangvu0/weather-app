# üå¶Ô∏è Weather App

A simple Node.js web application that provides real-time weather information for any location.  
This project was built by following along with [Andrew Mead's The Complete Node.js Developer Course (3rd Edition)](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/).  

The app demonstrates key Node.js concepts such as asynchronous programming, web servers, API integration, and deployment.

---

## Features
- Search for weather by location.
- Fetches weather data using the **Weatherstack API**.
- Converts user-provided locations into coordinates with the **Mapbox Geocoding v5 API**.
- Handles asynchronous operations in Node.js using callbacks.
- Built with **Express.js** for serving dynamic web content.
- Fully deployed for real-world use.
